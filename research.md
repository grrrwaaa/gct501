# What is research?

A advancement to current knowledge, produced by systematic work, that is *original, valid and significant* to the research community.

OECD: "Research comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."

Research consists of:

- Asking a question that nobody has asked before;
- Doing the necessary work to find the answer; and
- Communicating the knowledge you have acquired to a larger audience.

A research project's goal may be to establish or disprove facts, solve new or existing problems, develop theories, or otherwise expand past work in a field. 

**Basic research** is documentation, discovery, interpretation, for the pure advancement of human knowledge (i.e. without any specific or known applications in mind). It is predominantly carried out by universities and institutes. **Applied research** is systematic inquiry involving practical applications of theory and science toward state or business purposes, and tends to have more empirical and pragmatic methods. **Research & development** (R&D) is the development of methods, processes, services and products, typically ultimately for commercial profit.

In practice, research methods vary widely, depending upon the academic discipline’s accepted standards or a particular study’s needs. Research in science and engineering often involves conducting experiments in the lab or in the field. Research in the arts, humanities, and social sciences may include archival work, conducting surveys or in-depth interviews, and a wide range of creative and artistic projects.

Scientific research relies on the application of the scientific method, providing information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world.

Research in the humanities involves different methods, and a different, more relativist epistemology. Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead explore the issues and details that surround it. Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic. 

Artistic research, also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research and the object of research itself. 

Research is not a solitary activity –but an act of community. As a member of the research community, you are building on the knowledge that others have acquired before you and providing a road map for those who come after you. You are adding to a body of work that will never be complete. Research is an ongoing, collaborative process with no finish line in sight. 

### What is research in art?

Art as research has entered academic institutions relatively recently, and is still controversial for some. One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods. Like the social sciences it can use qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools to apply measurement, and critical analysis.

[Art makes the form the site of knowledge. Without rejecting the content. It is art itself that delineates its own borders.](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/disobedience-in-byelorussia-self-interrogation-on-%E2%80%9Cresearch-based-art%E2%80%9D/)

Music professor: "Composers write research papers to 'quantify who they are'. One often builds a 'grammar' used in compositions."
Music/CS professor: "One must consider what the benefit of research is 'outside of the artifact': what can one abstract from the work?"
Art professor: "'Artistic process' and 'artistic research' are the same thing."

Pablo Picasso: "I never made a painting as a work of art, it’s all research."

> ["Art-based research can be defined as the systematic use of the artistic
process, the actual making of artistic expressions in all of the different
forms of the arts, as a primary way of understanding and examining
experience by both researchers and the people that they involve in their
studies. These inquiries are distinguished from research activities where
the arts may play a significant role but are essentially used as data for
investigations that take place within academic disciplines that utilize
more traditional scientific, verbal, and mathematic descriptions and
analyses of phenomena."]

## The research idea

It should something you are genuinely interested in. What does your curiosity dwell on? Do you have an original idea or independent perspective to contribute? Something that is difficult yet that you care about enough to make real?

However often the problem statement of research is not apparent from the start. A literature review can identify flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often the literature review happens before the problem is identified. A gap in the current literature  engenders a research question, which may have a parallel hypothesis.

### Speculate

The broader motivation of great research is often highly speculative, and deeply questions or contradicts the status quo. Some questions you could ask yourselves:

- What does the world (my culture) need (right now, urgently)? And what of the future? 
- Forget the habits of today; what have we missed in the past? E.g. 'rear view mirror'. 
- What can you identify that differentiates the world-changing ideas from the common ideas?
- Architecture professor: "Take your brain and throw it into the future as far as you can. Take something said to be impossible and make it. The greater the impossibility, the greater the value of the contribution."
- What are the "ten questions" in the field? The unsolved problems that would be meaningful to solve.
- What has been predicted as the impending future -- and what does it need? Or, what is missing from these predictions?
	- For example, consider the [Pew Report into Digital Life in 2025](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/03/PIP_Report_Future_of_the_Internet_Predictions_031114.pdf)
- What is common to all works in a medium, and specific to a medium, yet only rarely articulated? Look for the elephant in the room. What can change our perception of the medium itself? What is the stigmatum. Or, what can be taken away without losing the essence?
- What is mountain to climb (not hill)? Go to the edge - there’s not that much there - work back.

Place your questions outside the field.

### Make concrete

Identify clearly the state of the art you are advancing (the field or domain). What are the assumptions in the field you are overthrowing? 

Or, you may be inventing your own field. Then don't try to legitimate a new field by making a case; show it by demonstration.

Definition of the problem.

The idea should be specific: research goes narrow & deep, not wide & shallow. What is the NARROW research problem? Keep returning to the original question; the articulation is usually too general, and needs to be sharpened.

What will you do & why is it worth doing?
What is the state of the art & where does your work fit?
What is the form of the contribution? (Technical, artistic/compositional/performance, theoretic, ...)?
What are the key decisions & unique differentials?

Diagrams, maps and keywords can be far more useful than prose.

## The proposal

A research **proposal** concisely summarizes the research project in a *problem statement*, whose validity, originality and significance is supported by an extensive *literature review*, background material in the literature, and the proposed approach of new research.

It should show:
	- Your independence of perspective (originality)
	- That you understand the field you are addressing (history, methods, values)
	- What specific works/projects/research it follows from
	- What particular ideas/theories/directions it contributes to
	- What is specifically excluded from your project
	- Outcomes: what are the tools/experiments/demonstrations etc. and why are they important
	- How will other researchers be able to reproduce or leverage your work?

### Development & Style 

Don't start from the beginning; start from what you already have & let the vision emerge. Narrow & deep: rather than starting from bigger vision, begin from a close-up and zoom out. 


Use *evidence-centered* language, not *I-centered* language: Not "I believe that..." but "prior research evidence shows that...". 

Nothing should be vague or ambiguous.

### Structure

- Working Title
	- Give a working title that describes the nature of your project. You may use a ‘poetic’ title, but it is useful to indicate, after a colon, the nature of the study or your approach.
- Statement of Aim
	- Identify the general subject area and outline how your topic relates to the field. 
	- Establish why it is a significant topic and what contribution your work will make.
- Problem Statement
	- identify what is and isn't in the purview
	- within that purview, identify the inconsistency, error or lack in current knowledge
	- identify the costs of this incosistency, error or lack
	- outline the contribution of your work regarding the problem
- Literature Review
	- In order to demonstrate that your project makes a significant contribution to the field, you need to show that you are aware of the traditions and ‘state of the art’ research in that field. The best approach is to start from your project and work out. Its purpose is to set-up your particular research project, and it should therefore be focused and evaluative, rather than general.
	- Often you will need to draw on literature from several fields in order to establish the niche in which your project sits. Many art-based projects establish their ‘contribution to knowledge’ by reviewing the literature in a non-art field and showing how art can interrogate something that the other literature has missed.
	- Bear in mind that the purpose of a review of the field is to establish not just innovation but significance. There is no need make your work conform to the models and expectations of areas outside your own. Use the literature review to define the parameters of your field.
	- Some projects take up a particular theoretical position, inspired by key philosophers, thinkers or practitioners. Rather than adopting an entire philosophy, you may propose to borrow specific concepts from certain writers and apply them to a particular area or within a particular practice. If you are doing this, identify which concepts are useful and how you will apply them in order to achieve a particular result.
- Method/Approach
	- Is it primarily quantitative or qualitative?
	- Does it involve experiments (how will they be evaluated)? Or empirical analysis?
	- Detail how your chosen method or approach will serve to advance your thesis or argument. Explain how the work you plan to make will test specific ideas or ‘hypotheses’, or uncover the best way of solving a complex problem.  
	- You might include a brief time-line or project plan with milestones.
	- What are you NOT going to do?
