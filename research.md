# GCT 501 Research Projects

Each team will build research skills by proposing a new project, and presenting the progress of conceptualization, development, and incremental refinement of the project. Presenting project ideas will begin in week 7 and progress presentations will continue until the end of the semester. Presentations will continue the style of the journal club, particularly the discussion and comments. This is a fantastic opportunity to get valuable feedback from your peers in the early stages of a new project!

The research will culminate in a project (either full project or prototype) along with appropriate documentation. It is strongly recommended to use skills developed in the supplementary programming/physical computing courses in the prototype. 

Teams should identify the intended destination of the project (specific upcoming conferences, festivals or other events, journals, grant RFPs, as a company startup proposal or crowd-funded project idea, etc.), perform in-depth investigation into the most significant related work, the key critical questions in the field, the modes of evaluation and distribution, software prototypes, and any other necessary steps to build the case for the final documentation. 

## Presentations

**Week 7:** Pitching ideas. Each team has about 10 minutes to pitch the project ideas they have identified. A team will probably have more than one idea to pitch, so keeping them concise is essential. You can think of it as an [elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch). 

(One effective way to present ideas is via a sketched poster, which could be hand-drawn & scanned/photographed. A poster will have a heading and a few diagrams/cartoon-like images to convey the idea with minimum text. A paper concept for software can include cutouts and post-it notes to indicate different UX experiences.) 

Each pitched idea should identify the intended research destination and community. 

This is an opportunity to get feedback on ideas, so leave time for audience questions! (However you may also get additional feedback through the online document). 

**Weeks 9-12:** Research project proposal. 

Each team has about 35-40 minutes to present their chosen project idea in full. This presentation should include the elements typical of structured research.

As before, this is an opportunity to get feedback on ideas, so leave time for audience questions! You may also get additional feedback through the online document. 

**Weeks 12-15**: Project progress reports. 

Each team has about 20 minutes to present their project progress. The key here is to convey differences since the last presentation, and as always use it as an opportunity for feedback and discussion. Differences could be:

- incrementally refined prototypes,
- new discoveries from more extended literature review, 
- new insights or ideas added to the project, 
- technical breakthroughs, 
- challenges encountered or limitations discovered, and strategies to overcome them,
etc.


## Research proposal

A research **proposal** concisely summarizes the research project in a *problem statement*, whose validity, originality and significance is supported by an extensive *literature review*, background material in the literature, and the proposed approach of new research. It shows your independence of thought (originality) and your awareness of the field (history and state-of-the-art).

- **Working Title**
	- Give a working title that describes the nature of your project. You may use a ‘poetic’ title, but it is useful to indicate, after a colon, the nature of the study or your approach.
- **Abstract/Statement of Aim**. A brief summary of project, plus the intended research destination / community.
	- Briefly identify the general subject area and outline how your topic relates to the field, why it is significant and what contribution it will make.
- **Literature review**.  
	- An in-depth review of the specific area (or areas) the project relates to, e.g. drawing upon best and/or most-cited papers in relevant conferences, most closely-related artworks in recent or historically notable exhibitions, etc. Who's done what and how your work fits in with it. 
	- This is the most important part of the presentation. Show the most related work in as much detail as possible, and discuss it critically. 
	- The best approach is to start from your project and work out. Its purpose is to set-up your particular research project, and it should therefore be focused and evaluative, rather than general.
	- Often you will need to draw on literature from several fields in order to establish the niche in which your project sits. Many art-based projects establish their ‘contribution to knowledge’ by reviewing the literature in a non-art field and showing how art can interrogate something that the other literature has missed.
	- Bear in mind that the purpose of a review of the field is to establish not just innovation but significance. There is no need make your work conform to the models and expectations of areas outside your own. Use the literature review to define the parameters of your field.
	- Some projects take up a particular theoretical position, inspired by key philosophers, thinkers or practitioners. Rather than adopting an entire philosophy, you may propose to borrow specific concepts from certain writers and apply them to a particular area or within a particular practice. If you are doing this, identify which concepts are useful and how you will apply them in order to achieve a particular result.
- **Problem Statement**
	- Continuing from the literature review, briefly and clearly identify what is wrong with current research results/ideas/methods/technology etc.
	- Identify how your project attempts to address this problem/gap: the contribution.
- **Motivation & significance**. 
	- Why the world needs this problem/gap to be addressed in the shape you are proposing. Identify the costs of this inconsistency, error or lack in the current knowledge, and the importance of addressing it in your proposed way.
	- Put simply: what you're trying to tell the intended audience that they don't already know, and why they need to know it.
- **Method & evaluation**. 
	- Why the intended audience should believe that you will be able to accomplish the goal. 
	- What technologies you will use, what research methods, what kinds of results you expect, how it will be presented and disseminated. 
	- Is it primarily quantitative or qualitative?
	- Does it involve experiments (how will they be evaluated)? Or empirical analysis?
	- Detail how your chosen method or approach will serve to advance your thesis or argument. Explain how the work you plan to make will test specific ideas or ‘hypotheses’, or uncover the best way of solving a complex problem.  
	- You might include a brief time-line or project plan with milestones.
	- What are you NOT going to do?
	- How the project will be evaluated (how do you know if it succeeds or fails). 
	- How it will be shared in a reproducible way.
	- Also identify any limitations (reasons why someone might doubt your story), and try to show what you will do to get rid of as much doubt as possible.

### Development & Style 

Don't start from the beginning; start from what you already have & let the vision emerge. Narrow & deep: rather than starting from bigger vision, begin from a close-up and zoom out. 

Use *evidence-centered* language, not *I-centered* language: Not "I believe that..." but "prior research evidence shows that...". Objective, not subjective.

Use diagrams or other visuals whenever these convey ideas more effectively than text, *so long as the diagrams are relevant!*.

Nothing should be vague or ambiguous.


## Final research documentation

A significant proportion of the final grade will depend on the final documentation.

The purpose of research documentation is:

- To connect with the broader community
- To demonstrate the validity and necessity of the research 
- To share the results in a reproducible way

What are your results and how does your work compare with other work in the field?
How did the decisions that you made impact your results and performance?
What future research should be pursued to build on your work?

Final documentation will include:

- **Video**. Documentation must include an edited video of high quality that captures the results of the prototype and presents the work as clearly and convincingly as possible. You may choose to upload the video to a social site such as Vimeo, YouTube etc, or use KAIST web space.
- **Website**. The website should collect the principal components of the research, from concept to prototype and collected results. The video documentation should be embedded into this website.   
The website itself might be the primary result: for example, it could be designed as a Kickstarter-like proposal intended to attract crowd-funding, a business startup proposal intended to attract investor funding, a new online media/social/portal/game/art/etc. concept, etc. In this case, the intended audience and research purpose of the site should be clearly identified. 
- **Engineering** (software/hardware). The technical layer of the project/prototype should be fully documented and included in the documentation. Any specific innovations or insights should be noted. You might wish to share your software via a social coding community such as GitHub or BitBucket, or hardware designs via a Maker community, or otherwise share implementation knowledge in a reproducible way. As noted previously, you may use work undertaken in the supplementary physical computing / JavaScript classes for the project.
- **(At least) one of:**
	- Academic paper. A paper need not have been submitted, but a document of sufficient quality should be prepared. The intended destination(s) of the paper should be clearly identified: i.e. which conferences or journals.
	- Installation / performance. Consider the video/website documentation as the primary component of an application to an upcoming festival or juried exhibition, as well as a portfolio piece. 
	- Grant application. The application need not have been submitted, but should be of s
	- Patent application. A patent application need not have been submitted, but a document of sufficient quality should be prepared.
