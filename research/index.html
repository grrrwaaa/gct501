# What is research?

> OECD: "Research comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

A advancement to current knowledge, produced by systematic work, that is *original, valid and significant* to the research community.

- Asking a question that nobody has asked before;
- Doing the necessary work to find the answer; and
- Communicating the knowledge you have acquired to a larger audience.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Research is the act of a community

As a member of the research community, you are building on the knowledge that others have acquired before you and providing a road map for those who come after you. You are adding to a body of work that will never be complete. 	

Research methods vary widely according to the values of different disciplines and communities. 								

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- Basic/pure research: pure knowledge, no known applications.
- Applied research: more progmatic, empirical. 
- Research & development (R&D): services/products, typically commercially driven.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Research is defined by community

- *Scientific research*
	- Application of the scientific method.
	- Providing information and theories to explain the nature and properties of the world. 
	- Often involves conducting experiments in the lab or in the field.
- *Research in the humanities* 
	- A more relativist epistemology: not searching for an ultimate correct answer, but instead exploring the issues and details that surround it. 
	- Context (social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic) is always important. 
	- Archival work, surveys or in-depth interviews.

### What is research in art?

Artistic research, also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research *and* the object of research itself. It must accept subjectivity. It may also use qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools for measurement and critical analysis.

Art as research has entered academic institutions relatively recently, and is still controversial:

- Is art research?
- If so, how is it defined, and how is it evaluated?

### What is research in art? 

- Music professor: "Composers write research papers to 'quantify who they are'. One often builds a 'grammar' used in compositions."
- Music/CS professor: "One must consider what the benefit of research is 'outside of the artifact': what can one abstract from the work?"
- Art professor: "'Artistic process' and 'artistic research' are the same thing."

- Pablo Picasso: "I never made a painting as a work of art, it’s all research."

### What is research in art? 

> "Art-based research can be defined as the systematic use of the artistic
process, the actual making of artistic expressions in all of the different
forms of the arts, as a primary way of understanding and examining
experience by both researchers and the people that they involve in their
studies. These inquiries are distinguished from research activities where
the arts may play a significant role but are essentially used as data for
investigations that take place within academic disciplines that utilize
more traditional scientific, verbal, and mathematic descriptions and
analyses of phenomena." [From here](https://www.moz.ac.at/files/pdf/fofoe/ff_abr.pdf)

> "Art makes the form the site of knowledge. Without rejecting the content. It is art itself that delineates its own borders." [From here](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/disobedience-in-byelorussia-self-interrogation-on-%E2%80%9Cresearch-based-art%E2%80%9D/)

# The research idea

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Grounded speculation

It should something you are genuinely interested in. What does your curiosity dwell on? Do you have an original idea or independent perspective to contribute? Something that is difficult yet that you care about enough to make real? 

Often the problem statement of research is not apparent from the start. A *literature review* can identify flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often the literature review happens before the problem is identified. A gap in the current literature engenders a research question, which may have a parallel hypothesis.

Through a feedback of speculation and grounding the idea can become more concrete and specific.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Speculate

The broader motivation is often highly speculative, and often deeply questions or contradicts the status quo. Ask yourself:

- What does (the world / my culture / my discipline) need (right now / in the future)? 
	- What are the "ten questions" in your field? 
	- What has been predicted as the impending future -- and what does it need? Or, what is missing from these predictions?
		- For example, consider the [Pew Report into Digital Life in 2025](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/03/PIP_Report_Future_of_the_Internet_Predictions_031114.pdf)
- Or, forget the habits of today; what have we missed in the past? 
	- Remember the [rear-view mirror](http://lightthroughmcluhan.org/rearviewmirror.html)
- Or, place your questions outside the field.
	- What is common to all works in a medium, and specific to a medium, yet only rarely articulated? Look for the [elephant in the room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room). What can change our perception of the medium itself? Or, what can be taken away without losing the essence?
	- What is mountain to climb (not hill)? Go to the edge - there’s not that much 	there - work back. 
- What can you identify that differentiates world-changing ideas from common ideas?
	- Architecture professor: "Take your brain and throw it into the future as far as you can. Take something said to be impossible and make it. The greater the impossibility, the greater the value of the contribution."

</script></section>	
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Make concrete

Work toward a definition of the problem that is *clear, concrete, and narrow*.

At early stages, diagrams, maps and keywords can be far more useful than prose.

*Use the literature*

- Identify clearly the state of the art you are advancing (the field or domain). What are the assumptions in the field you are overthrowing? 
	- Or, you may be inventing your own field. Then don't try to legitimate a new field by making a case; show it by demonstration.
- The idea should be specific: research goes narrow & deep, not wide & shallow. Keep returning to the original question; the articulation is usually too general, and needs to be sharpened.
	- What will you do & why is it worth doing?
	- What is the state of the art & where does your work fit?
	- What is the form of the contribution? (Technical, artistic/compositional/performance, theoretic, ...)?
	- What are the key decisions & unique differentials?
