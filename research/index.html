# What is research?

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

> OECD: "Research comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications."

</script></section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

A advancement to current knowledge, produced by systematic work, that is *original, valid and significant* to the research community.

- Asking a question that nobody has asked before;
- Doing the necessary work to find the answer; and
- Communicating the knowledge you have acquired to a larger audience.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Research is the act of a community

As a member of the research community, you are building on the knowledge that others have acquired before you and providing a road map for those who come after you. You are adding to a body of work that will never be complete. 	

Research methods vary widely according to the values of different disciplines and communities. 								

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

- Basic/pure research: pure knowledge, no known applications.
- Applied research: more progmatic, empirical. 
- Research & development (R&D): services/products, typically commercially driven.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Research is defined by community

- *Scientific research*
	- Application of the scientific method.
	- Providing information and theories to explain the nature and properties of the world. 
	- Often involves conducting experiments in the lab or in the field.
- *Research in the humanities* 
	- A more relativist epistemology: not searching for an ultimate correct answer, but instead exploring the issues and details that surround it. 
	- Context (social, historical, political, cultural or ethnic) is always important. 
	- Archival work, surveys or in-depth interviews.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### What is research in art?

Artistic research, also seen as 'practice-based research', can take form when creative works are considered both the research *and* the object of research itself. It must accept subjectivity. It may also use qualitative research and intersubjectivity as tools for measurement and critical analysis.

Art as research has entered academic institutions relatively recently, and is still controversial:

- Is art research?
- If so, how is it defined, and how is it evaluated?

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### What is research in art? 

- Music professor: "Composers write research papers to 'quantify who they are'. One often builds a 'grammar' used in compositions."
- Music/CS professor: "One must consider what the benefit of research is 'outside of the artifact': what can one abstract from the work?"
- Art professor: "'Artistic process' and 'artistic research' are the same thing."

- Pablo Picasso: "I never made a painting as a work of art, it’s all research."

</script></section>

### What is research in art? 

> "Art-based research can be defined as the systematic use of the artistic
process, the actual making of artistic expressions in all of the different
forms of the arts, as a primary way of understanding and examining
experience by both researchers and the people that they involve in their
studies. These inquiries are distinguished from research activities where
the arts may play a significant role but are essentially used as data for
investigations that take place within academic disciplines that utilize
more traditional scientific, verbal, and mathematic descriptions and
analyses of phenomena." [From here](https://www.moz.ac.at/files/pdf/fofoe/ff_abr.pdf)

> "Art makes the form the site of knowledge. Without rejecting the content. It is art itself that delineates its own borders." [From here](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/disobedience-in-byelorussia-self-interrogation-on-%E2%80%9Cresearch-based-art%E2%80%9D/)

# The research idea

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Grounded speculation

It should something you are genuinely interested in. What does your curiosity dwell on? Do you have an original idea or independent perspective to contribute? Something that is difficult yet that you care about enough to make real? 

Often the problem statement of research is not apparent from the start. A *literature review* can identify flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study. Often the literature review happens before the problem is identified. A gap in the current literature engenders a research question, which may have a parallel hypothesis.

Through a feedback of speculation and grounding the idea can become more concrete and specific.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Speculate

The broader motivation is often highly speculative, and often deeply questions or contradicts the status quo. Ask yourself:

- What does (the world / my culture / my discipline) need (right now / in the future)? 
	- What are the "ten questions" in your field? 
	- What has been predicted as the impending future -- and what does it need? Or, what is missing from these predictions?
		- For example, consider the [Pew Report into Digital Life in 2025](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/03/PIP_Report_Future_of_the_Internet_Predictions_031114.pdf)
- Or, forget the habits of today; what have we missed in the past? 
	- Remember the [rear-view mirror](http://lightthroughmcluhan.org/rearviewmirror.html)
- Or, place your questions outside the field.
	- What is common to all works in a medium, and specific to a medium, yet only rarely articulated? Look for the [elephant in the room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room). What can change our perception of the medium itself? Or, what can be taken away without losing the essence?
	- What is mountain to climb (not hill)? Go to the edge - there’s not that much 	there - work back. 
- What can you identify that differentiates world-changing ideas from common ideas?
	- Architecture professor: "Take your brain and throw it into the future as far as you can. Take something said to be impossible and make it. The greater the impossibility, the greater the value of the contribution."

</script></section>	
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Make concrete

Work toward a definition of the problem that is *clear, concrete, and narrow*.

At early stages, diagrams, maps and keywords can be far more useful than prose.

*Use the literature*

- Identify clearly the state of the art you are advancing (the field or domain). What are the assumptions in the field you are overthrowing? 
	- Or, you may be inventing your own field. Then don't try to legitimate a new field by making a case; show it by demonstration.
- The idea should be specific: research goes narrow & deep, not wide & shallow. Keep returning to the original question; the articulation is usually too general, and needs to be sharpened.
	- What will you do & why is it worth doing?
	- What is the state of the art & where does your work fit?
	- What is the form of the contribution? (Technical, artistic/compositional/performance, theoretic, ...)?
	- What are the key decisions & unique differentials?

## Lombard & Ditton

Presence as continuous maintenance of an “illusion of non-mediation”

----

- social richness (intimacy, immediacy), 
- realism (perceptual, social), 
- immersion (the suppression of the real, psychological absorption), 
- transportation (you are there, it is here, we are together), 
- as an actor within the medium (virtual characters), 
- global anthropomorphic projection (experiencing the medium as an actor in itself).

----

Continuous involvement of sensory, cognitive and affective processing.

Illusion of non-mediation either by making it invisible, or by transforming it into a social entity. 

(*But where do we draw the line of what is or is not mediated?*)
</script></section>	
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">	
## Agency

Humans behaving as if the mediation was not there.

Importance of action: "Being-there" is "Being-able-to-act-upon", echoing affordance theory (Gibson).
Presence is more correlated with experience of agency than illusion (Herrera et al.): the power to take meaningful action.

Agency strongly related to body (interior vs. exterior): internal agency emanates from within body, are predictable, repeatable and non-observational; exterior phenomena are observered but unpredictable (Gonzalez-Franco et al.) 
Note connection to Minsky's original telepresence concept:   
*being in a different place* + *body of the machine becoming the body of the human*

## Creating Artificial Natures

Intuitive, multimodal interaction with a computational simulation of a complex ecosystem, experienced within rich multi-sensory environments   
in gallery or dedicated media-facility

Immersive display: large-scale, wide field-of-view, stereographics, high frame-rates, 3D spatial audio. 

Multi-modal input: touch surfaces, ambient microphones, infra-red camera, depth camera   
Natural/transparent UI/UX?

Found that low-latency, high-bandwidth is essential

Surround sound and spatial ambience significantly increased the sense of “being there”

## Time of Doubles

Stereographics confer "weight" to the world, at cost of personal encumbrance 

Shadows greatly aided sense of depth

Correct off-axis, semi-cylindrical projection (and stereo parallax) for average user was very helpful

Stereographic projection makes a significant difference, at the cost of being encumbered with glasses. Other depth- cues were helpful (particularly shadows). 

We believe the most important contributor to presence is interaction with the animate content.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Interaction design

Concept: visitor becomes integral part of ecosystem   
(goal of immersion derived from this)

Visitors are neither observers nor god-like maniplulators   
consequences easy to perceive but difficult to predict
interaction is both voluntary and involuntary

Action in (or mere occupation of) real space affects ecosystem by introducing kinetic forces and chemical material

World is populated by various life forms swimming and chemicals floating in a dark fluid

Visitors can recognize their double-images:   
IR depth cameras (Kinects) project into virtual space   
Not as avatar, but using point-cloud as a source of high-energy nutrients   
Organisms must consume these nutrients to metabolize, survive and reproduce   
Visitors thus hear, see, and feel how they are fed to unknown lifeforms

Optical flow over point cloud used to introduce fluid currents as visitors move 
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Double presence

Visitor identification with the double is rapid and persistent despite the unusual appearance. 

Humans can very easily project psychologically onto double-images (despite the third-person perspective), just as we do with mirrors and avatars. 

Contribution of low-latency and high-bandwidth synchronous correlate (Gonzalez-Franco et al.). Furthermore, a double may "serve the execution of a task which without the mirror would become much harder" (Hand, 1994)

Nevertheless the installation is largely taskless. Visitors may discover/invent a diversity of performative roles through the actions and nuances the installation and their bodies support. Although no goal is pre-specified, these roles may still confer presence through agency.

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

There is no manual. Learn by discovery, as in nature.

standing still: doubles intensify into flaming figures
populations approach and consume them, multiplying rapidly once discovered
hear the isolated chirps explode into dense sound clouds

move away: see the currents and eddies diffuse through space
see the population become fragmented, and evolve into audibly distinct branches
conduct sound-scapes

guide organisms through space by leaving particle trails
create vortices by spinning
kick up nutrients from the floor
accumulate particles to high density then propel through fluid
create bridges of populations between each other

agency reinforce interior/exterior through bodily action (despite non-human roles)

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

## Social aspects

Multi-user, multi-perspective ("locally telematic") supports "being together"
though identification of other double identity can be difficult

However most visitors focus on interaction with organisms

Suggest a presence which is not-quite-social, more than machinic; “ethological”?

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

Visitors report strong presence in the artwork.	

Lombard and Ditton: make mediation invisible, or transform into social entity.

We do not attempt to hide the screens; they are a sculptural object. 
The warped screens appear to "extend" the physical space. Not a "you are there", perhaps more "it is here"? Visitors appear ready to accept both media object and illusion of non-mediation simulataneously. 

Do interactions with organisms transform into a social level? Extend L&D 'virtual pets' discussion to an entire ecology?

Charles Darwin, in his 1835 visit, described the Galapagos archipelago as “a little world within itself”. His observations contributed to the inception of his theory of evolution by natural selection. 

He noted how the boundaries between islands appeared to undermine the stability of the concept of species.  Every island is a different niche, and the diversity of niches drives the diversity of life.

## Final thoughts

Designed for consistency: all perceptible elements are dynamic and inter-related. 
Phenomena have a developmental/systematic explanation; not random.
World is sensitive to humans but does not require them. 

Despite complexiy of system, experience need not be complicated.
Principles & complexity required to deepen sense of presence in a world and support open-endedness through exploratory interaction; such that each spectator can have their own insights integrating play, observation, and aesthetic experience. 

</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Continuations

To understand presence in interactive art: take into account the multi-layered, non-task oriented character, but also the critical context in which it operates.

Today's cultural context is increasingly "immersed in computation".  

We may construct this as an infinite rather than a finite game: openly changing rules with a goal of transformative continuation and inclusive becoming-together.

We hope the experiences of artificial natures reflect upon our relation with the natural world and transform our conception of what “artificial” means.
