An introduction to programming for media and culture technologies, using the [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) language.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS), also known as [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), JScript, or ActionScript,  is a language of growing importance at the intersection of media/culture technology. 

It has become the de facto 'language of the web', having evolved from lightweight scripting roots to a full-fledged application language with powerful capabilities in HTML5. Not only is it used pervasively in client browser-based applications, it is also used for high-performance server applications, particularly using the [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) system. It has also been used as an embedded scripting language for applications by Google, Adobe, OpenOffice, Apple, MicroSoft, Qt, GNOME, etc., including many media-oriented applications such as Max/MSP/Jitter, [Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing.js), Logic Pro, Unity, DX Studio, Maxwell Render, Flash, etc., and many games/game engines.

A browser-based JS application may will on Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, iOS etc., so long as browser applications are up to date. In recent years this has meant that even audio signal processing and 3D OpenGL are available for use. Web-based applications open up easy possibilities to reach out to vast audiences and connect to social and other media networks. 

The size of the JS community is such that 'everything gets ported to JS eventually...', and often sooner than later; for example [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) is a vast (almost 60,000 at time of writing) collection of libraries for node.js (desktop/server-side applications). Node + browser applications can also be wrapped into traditional desktop apps using [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki). 

JS is a primarily imperative, procedural language (just like C, Java, Python, etc.), however it also supports functional programming features such as first-class functions. It is dynamically-typed and object-based, but uses [prototype-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) rather than class-based inheritance. Although it is a dynamic language, JS virtual machines such as [Google's V8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) can achieve remarkably high performance through implicit Just-In-Time compilation to machine code. 

> Note: Despite the similarity of name, JavaScript has no particular relation to Java. 

JavaScript has become the language of choice for several Introduction to Computer Science (CS101) courses, including at [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/) (also [here](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101)). The Khan Academy also offers [a free, online course](https://www.khanacademy.org/cs).
