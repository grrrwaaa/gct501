# GCT501: Introduction to Culture Technology

KAIST Graduate School of Culture Technology, Spring 2014

> Note: CT501 is also supported by [a supplementary programming course (using the JavaScript language](https://github.com/grrrwaaa/gct501/blob/master/js.md)). All students must sign up for this supplementary course or the physical computing course (or both!).

Where are we? Where did our world come from, and where are we going? The goal of this course is to develop solid grounding in the many diverse yet vital threads running through the mutual coevolution of culture and technology, both historical and contemporary, both practical and theoretical. 

## Format

The first component of the course will emphasize significant milestones in the history and development of culture technology through individual deep reading, group discussion and follow-up research. The second component will organize students into small teams, building research skills through the conceptualization, development, incrementally refined presentation of a proposed project.

### Journal Club: readings + discussion

A selection of reading (and viewing/listening) materials will be offered, somewhat in the style of a [Journal Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_club). 

Each student must join a pair and choose one of the recommended papers to study in detail. Each class, three pairs will present a 10-15 minute summary of their chosen paper, giving an overview and detailing any areas of particular interest. No presentation slides are necessary, just the paper, and any online material found relevant. Class discussion of the presented ideas is **very very strongly encouraged**!

In addition to discussion during class, each student should develop an original critical question or insightful comment for one of the week's presented papers, and enter this into a shared document. The question/comment should include at least one reference outside of the materials given; this could be another important research paper, artwork, engineering breakthrough or other cultural product. Include a URL with your reference. The professors will also contribute a question/commment, as an example. You can also read other's questions/comments and propose a response to at least one of them. We will work through these questions, comments, and responses through group discussion and follow-up investigations in the following class.

### Team projects and class presentations

After completing student surveys in weeks 1/2, teams will be allocated in week 3. Teams will have approximately four members, aiming for an even distribution of background expertise and seniority. Each team will develop a project idea and propose this idea several times through the course, starting around week 6 or 7, culminating in a prototype and documentation (video, academic paper, patent application etc.). It is **strongly recommended** to use skills developed in the supplementary programming/physical computing courses in the prototype.

Teams should identify the intended destination of the project (specific upcoming conferences, festivals or other events, or journals, grant RFPs, or perhaps a company startup proposal, etc.), perform in-depth investigation into the most significant related work, the key critical questions in the field, the modes of evalutation and distribution, software prototypes, and any other necessary steps to build the case for the final presentation. Teams are expected to give two presentations in the second half of the course (two teams per class). The first presentation should emphasize literature review for the relevant field, e.g. drawing upon best papers in recent conferences; continuing the style of the journal club (including the discussion and comments). The second presentation will be a progress report on the developing prototype. 

## Grading

Grade weights will be balanced approximately 50/50 according to the individual reading responses and the team project evaluations.
