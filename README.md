The goal of this course is to develop solid grounding in the many diverse yet vital threads running through the mutual coevolution of culture and technology, both historical and contemporary, both practical and theoretical. 

## Format

The first component of the course will emphasize significant milestones in the history and development of culture technology through individual deep reading, group discussion and follow-up research. The second component will organize students into small teams, building research skills through the conceptualization, development, incrementally refined presentation of a proposed project.

### Individual readings & class discussion

Each week a selection of reading (and viewing/listening) materials will be offered. Each student should become familiar with this material, and develop an original critical question or insightful comment for one of these materials, and enter this into a shared document. Your question/comment should include at least one reference outside of the materials given; this could be another important research paper, artwork, engineering breakthrough or other cultural product. Include a URL with your reference. The professors will also contribute a question/commment, as an example.

> However, if the same question/comment has already been made by another student, you will need to think of a new one. Also, if the quota of questions/comments for that article has already been used up, you will need to submit a question/comment for a different one. 

In addition to your comment/question, you should also read other's questions/comments and propose a response to at least one of them. We will work through these questions, comments, and responses through group discussion and follow-up investigations in the following class.

### Team projects and class presentations

After completing student surveys in weeks 1/2, teams will be allocated in week 3. Teams will have approximately four members, aiming for an even distribution of background expertise and seniority. Each team will develop a project idea and propose this idea several times through the course, with the first presentation around week 6 or 7. 

Teams should identify the intended destination of the project (specific upcoming conferences, festivals or other events, or journals, grant RFPs, or perhaps a company startup proposal, etc.), perform in-depth investigation into the most significant related work, the key critical questions in the field, the modes of evalutation and distribution, software prototypes, and any other necessary steps to build the case for the final presentation.

## Grading

Grade weights will be balanced approximately 50/50 according to the individual reading responses and the team project evaluations.
